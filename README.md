# Diagnosing a Failure in an Autonomous Vehicle: Alice Example

This repository contains the code to run the Alice example for the paper "A Compositional Approach to Diagnosing Faults in Cyber-Physical Systems". This code makes use of the diagnostics augmentation in [Pacti's source code](https://github.com/pacti-org/pacti/tree/proplogic). For more information about Pacti, please refer to [Pacti's homepage](https://www.pacti.org).

### Install:
